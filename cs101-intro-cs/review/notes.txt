What was the first modern computer?

EIANC

What is the decimal number of 1011010
90

What is an advantage of using a high level programming language
The developer does not have come up with high detail machine instruction like garbage collection

What is the advantage of OOP development

OOP makes it cheaper to develop because development is faser

What best describes a abstract

Abstract does not allow objects of a prototype to be created

What describes a java class
 A Java class includes fields that represent the state of an object and methods used to work with that object.

What is true about importing Java libraries

Order does not matter

What is the value of the following Java expression? Enter a numeric answer.
3

What is the equivilant to !(a < b || !((b < c) || (c < d)))
a >= b && ( ( b < c ) || ( c < d ) )

What is equivilant to !(x > 5 && y > 3)

x <= 5 || y <= 3

Choose the correct result and explanation for the evaluation of the following explanation: 
The correct answer is: false, because 2 + 3 = 5 is not less than 5


Choose the correct result and explanation for the evaluation of the following explanation: 

Choose the correct result and explanation for the evaluation of the following explanation: 


x = 2;
boolean b = (x = 5) || (x > 6);

What are the values of x and b after these statements are executed?

 x = 5, b = true


boolean b = (x < y) && ((x = ++y) > 4);
x = 5, y = 2

First x <= y is evaluated, and then y <= z is evaluated if and only if x <= y is true.

&& is simular to || where if the first argument is false it does not evaluate the rest of the comparision its always false unless all true.

The notation used to write relational and logical expressions in Java is
infix


 x <= 5 || y <= 3 


void printsquare( double x )
{
    x = x * x;
    System.out.println( “square: ” + x );
}

and the following code that calls it:

double y = 5;
printsquare( y );

What is the value of y after the function printsquare is called? Enter a numeric answer.

The value of y is copied to the value of x declared within printsquare. Although x is squared, this does not affect the value of y, because x and y are separate variables.
The correct answer is: 5


Consider the method declarations:

int mymethod( int x, int y )

double mymethod( int a, int b )

These declarations are

The correct answer is: Invalid because the parameter types are the same for both, making them ambiguous
	
The signature of a method consists of the following attributes:
The correct answer is: the method name and the types of its parameters.



The correct answer is: The return value of a method of type void is used.

Which of the following Java statements is a correct declaration of an array of ten elements of type double?
 double[] x = new double[10];

Consider the statements:

int[] x = new int[5];
x[0] = 2;
System.out.println(“Second element: ” + x[1]);

Consider the following code fragment. Assume that x is a previously defined array of type int[]

int max = 0;
for ( int i = 0; i < x.length; i++ )
    if ( x[i] > max )
        max = x[i];

Which of the following statements is true?

The code may return an incorrect value for max in some cases.

What value is printed?
The correct answer is: 0

Complete the following code fragment so that it uses an enhanced for loop to find the minimum of an array. Assume that x is a previously defined array of type int[]. 

int val;
min = x[0];
for ( _______________ )
    if ( val < min )
        min = val;

The correct answer is: val : x

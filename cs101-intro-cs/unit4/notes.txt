The notation used to write relational and logical expressions in Java is
infix

Explain how the expression (x <= y) && (y <= z)is evaluated.

First x <= y is evaluated, and then y <= z is evaluated if and only if x <= y is true.


Suppose that the expression


!(a < b || !((b < c) || (c < d)))

is rewritten as an expression that does not use the negation operator. Fill in the blanks with the appropriate relational and logical operators by dragging the correct answers onto the image.

a >= b && ( ( b < c ) || ( c < d ) )

Which of the following expressions is equivalent to !(x > 5 && y > 3)?
The correct answer is: x <= 5 || y <= 3
